## PhD Research

I am a PhD student at King's College London and Imperial College London studying Computer Science in the [Safe and Trusted AI Centre for Doctoral Training](https://safeandtrustedai.org). My doctoral research is about framing "explanation" in the context of *multi-agent communication* so as to explcitly take into account the recipient of the explanation (who we call the *explainee*). This research is inherently interdisciplinary; notably involving philosophy, social science, and cognitive science. 

## Other Interests

Outside of my PhD research I am broadly interested in language and cognitive science. This has led me to studying the exciting field of _emergent communication_ in reinforcement learning, and to studying inductive biases for deep learning systems that could facilitate more robust behaviour by having systems explicitly mimick cognitive functions such as analogy-making and information retrieval. 

## News

_April 13, 2022:_ I am excited to announce that I will be joining Stuart Russell's group the [Center for Human Compatible AI](https://humancompatible.ai/) at U.C. Berkeley this summer for a four month internship! I will be working with [Justin Svegliato](https://justinsvegliato.com/) on a project in "AI metareasoning".

_April 7, 2022:_ I have won a "Best Reviewer Award" for my work reviewing papers for [EmeCome@ICLR22](https://sites.google.com/view/emecom2022/home)! Thank you to the organisers for this recognition, and the gift of Fuji Sencha tea :)

_April 1, 2022:_ My paper ["Joining the Conversation: Towards Language Acquisition for Ad Hoc Team Play"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SLqgf7ZCQbq) written with my PhD supervisor [Peter McBurney](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/peter.mcburney/) has been accepted to the [the Emergent Communication Workshop at the International Conference on Learning Representations (EmeCome@ICLR22)](https://sites.google.com/view/emecom2022/home). I will lead a discussion group on the topic of the paper at the workshop.

_March 27, 2021:_ My paper "A Measure of Explanatory Effectiveness" written with my PhD supervisor [Peter McBurney](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/peter.mcburney/) has been accepted to the [1st International Workshop on Trusted Automated Decision-Making](https://3drationality.com/TADM2021/). I gave a talk at the workshop on the paper.

_Dec 31, 2020:_ My paper ["Learning to Communicate with Strangers via Channel Randomisation Methods"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FaBSE8jcuf6hGIbbp34Dxu7jPjh0iJl0/view?usp=sharing) written with [Nandi Schoots](https://safeandtrustedai.org/person/nandi-schoots/) was accepted to [the Emergent Communication Workshop at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (EmeCom@NeurIPS2020)](https://sites.google.com/view/emecom2020/home).
