### Introduction

Evolution is the only process that we know of that can produce the wonderous complexities of the natural world.
From ant colonies to nervous systems, from bee waggle-dances to human language.
I have had a long standing interest in evolution, but it was intensified in early 2022 when I rewatched [Robert Sapolsky's Human Behavioural Biology](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL848F2368C90DDC3D) lectures and read Neil Shubin's [_Some Assembly Required_](https://www.amazon.com/Some-Assembly-Required-Decoding-Billion/dp/1101871334).
In particular, my renewed interest was focused on the role of _gene regulation_ in the evolution of complex multicellular systems.
Multicellularity is an interesting form of cooperation between individuals, in which their very individuality is given up.
But to coordinate this cooperative endeavour, cells take specialised roles in the organism.
So I revisted a simulation I start in 2016, during my undergraduate.
