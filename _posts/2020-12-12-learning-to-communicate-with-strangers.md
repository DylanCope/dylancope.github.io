### Introduction

In this post I am going to give a high-level overview of a paper that I wrote with my colleague [Nandi Schoots](https://safeandtrustedai.org/person/nandi-schoots/) called "Learning to Communication with Strangers via Channel Randomisation Methods". 
This work was presented at the 4th Emergent Communication Workshop at NeurIPS 2020, so we will start this article with a quick overview of the nascent field of emergent communication. 
The full paper can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/view/emecom2020/accepted-papers) alongside the other accepted papers at the workshop, and the source code for the project can be found on [this Github repository](https://github.com/DylanCope/zero-shot-comm).
Citation information can be found at the bottom of this page.


### Emergent Communication

The field of emergent communication studies how learning agents in a shared environment may develop strategies involving communication to solve their tasks.
This may involve the signalling of information, relaying instructions, deception, etc.
A powerful example of this is OpenAI's work in training agents to communicate with a "grounded and compositional" learned language (see their blog post on the work [here](https://openai.com/blog/learning-to-communicate/). 
A grounded language is one in which the meanings of words (communicated utterances) is tied to the environment in which the speakers and listeners are working within.
Compositionality is to do with how words can be arranged together in order to construct more complex communications. For instance, if I have words for "red-ball", "green-ball", and "go-to", I could _compose_ "go-to" with either of the ball words to construct a new and valid sentence.
