excerpt: It has been argued that communication is a key part of intelligence, and efforts have been made to develop AI systems that communicate, but these approaches are still in their infancy.

### Communicative Autostimulation

In his 1991 book, *Consciousness Explained*, Daniel Dennett sketches a hypothetical, "just-so" story for the evolution of language. We start by considering some early ancestors of ours on the verge of developing language. These early Homo sapiens would have been endowed by natural selection with some basic communicative instincts, such as making vocalisations or gestures to indicate such sentiments as "There's No Food Here", or "Danger Ahead". Such talents have [already been noted in other hominid](https://primatology.net/2011/03/09/the-semantics-of-vervet-monkey-alarm-calls-part-i/) species, so it is not a stretch to suppose that we also started with something like this. Dennett asks us to speculate that perhaps when one of these protohumans were stuck on a project, say cracking open a nut or searching for an item, they could "ask for information" from another member of their community. For this practice to be of any use, there would need to be the codevelopment of another talent: answering these calls for information.

One fine day in this imaginary world, we are invited suppose that one of these creatures, being clumsy and irrational, makes an information-seeking vocalisation when no-one is around to hear... except themselves! Upon hearing their own utterance, they are overcome with the desire to answer their own question. A peculiar occurence, but to the creature's delight they have found what they needed to find. They have probed themself for information by using their protolanguage as a mechanism for getting different parts of their own brain to talk to one another. The following figure, taken from Dennett's book, shows this information transveral graphically. Knowledge about `X` is transfered to a disconnected part of the brain through the speech act.

Dennett goes on show us how such "crude habits" of autostimulation might get baked into the genetic code of the species by virtue of [the Baldwin effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin_effect): individuals who autostimulate are able to solve more problems than those who don't, and thereby incur a fitness boost. This means that when autostimulation becomes a learned habit, those who are not predisposed to the behaviour are at a disadvantage and will not be expected to last for much longer. As the arms race continues some might stumble upon the behaviour of making the vocalisations more and more quietly so as to strategise privately and outsmart other members of their species. There is even [some evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subvocalization) in the form of movements of laryx when us humans think the words in our minds that suggests an evolutionary history like what we've just described.  

### Baby AI's First Words

Despite Dennet's sketch being fabricated, it at least presents a plausible mechanism by which an agent might gain capabilities. As AI developers, a good strategy would be to open up a many such paths to developing more intelligence for our systems.
