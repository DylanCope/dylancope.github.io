_Apr 16, 2024:_ My paper "Channel Randomisation Methods for Zero-Shot Communication" has been accepted to the **European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI)**. I look forward to presenting this work in October in Santiago de Compostela, Spain!

_May 9, 2024:_ I have been accepted to attend the [_Cooperative AI Summer School 2024_](https://www.cooperativeai.com/summer-school/summer-school-2024), in Santa Cruz, CA, August 2024!

_May 5, 2023:_ My paper "Mimicry and the Emergence of Cooperative Communication" has been accepted to the [2024 Conference on Artificial Life](https://2024.alife.org/) for an oral presentation and publication in the proceedings. The conference will be hosted at Copenhagen ITU. I look foward to presenting my research and meeting alifer friends :) 

_Apr 16, 2024:_ My paper ["Learning Translations: Emergent Communication Pretraining for Cooperative Language Acquisition"](https://dylancope.com/translation-learning/) has been accepted to the **International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI)**. I look forward to presenting this work in August in Jeju, South Korea!

_Dec 12, 2023:_ Alongside Nandi Schoots and Murray Shanahan, I supervised Ole Jorgenson for his Masters project at Imperial College London.
We continued the project and turned it into a [workshop paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03813) that has been accepted to the [Human-Centric Representation Learning Workshop (HCRL)](https://hcrl-workshop.github.io/2024/index.html) at AAAI-24,
and the AAAI-24 [Responsible Language Modeling (ReLM)](https://sites.google.com/vectorinstitute.ai/relm2024/accepted-papers?authuser=0) workshop.
Come check out the results in Language Model activation steering. 
**Update (02/24):** We won the Best Paper Award at HCRL!

_Dec 11, 2023:_ My paper "Learning Translations: Emergent Communication Pretraining for Cooperative Language Acquisition" has been accepted to [Ad Hoc Teamwork Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/ad-hoc-teamwork/home?authuser=0) at AAAI-24. I'll be in Vancouver at end of Feb 2024.

_Aug 20, 2023:_ I presented my work with Justin Svegliato and Stuart Russell, ["Learning to Plan with Tree Search via Deep RL"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=IP5kPfDu3w) at the [Bridging the Gap Between AI Planning and Reinforcement Learning (PRL @ IJCAI 2023)](https://prl-theworkshop.github.io/prl2023-ijcai/) Workshop at IJCAI 2023!

_June 6th, 2023:_ I will be at the CHAI Workshop on the 17th of June, 2023, presenting a poster on my work on applying Deep Reinforcement Learning to Tree Search, done in collaboration with Justin Svegliato and Stuart Russell.

_May 5, 2023:_ My paper ["Real-time Evolution of Multicellularity with Artificial Gene Regulation"](https://direct.mit.edu/isal/proceedings/isal/35/77/116930) has been accepted to the [2023 Conference on Artificial Life](https://2023.alife.org/) for an oral presentation and publication in the proceedings. The conference will be hosted at Hokkaido University on July 24th to July 28th, 2023.

_May 4, 2023:_ Nandi Schoots presented our paper ["Low-Entropy Latent Variables Harm Out-of-Distribution Performance"](https://domaingen.github.io/accepted) at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) Domain Generalization Workshop. 

_September 22, 2022:_ I am helping a group of fellow London-based PhD students to organise the [Safe and Trustworthy AI Workshop](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~chs219/stai-workshop/) on the 2nd of November, 2022, aimed at bringing together early-career researchers. Submit abstracts by the **28/09/2022**.

_April 13, 2022:_ I am excited to announce that I will be joining Stuart Russell's group the [Center for Human Compatible AI](https://humancompatible.ai/) at U.C. Berkeley this summer for a four month internship! I will be working with [Justin Svegliato](https://justinsvegliato.com/) on a project in "AI metareasoning".

_April 7, 2022:_ I have won a "Best Reviewer Award" for my work reviewing papers for [EmeCom@ICLR22](https://sites.google.com/view/emecom2022/home)! Thank you to the organisers for this recognition, and the gift of Fuji Sencha tea :)

_April 1, 2022:_ My paper ["Joining the Conversation: Towards Language Acquisition for Ad Hoc Team Play"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SLqgf7ZCQbq) written with my PhD supervisor [Peter McBurney](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/peter.mcburney/) has been accepted to the [the Emergent Communication Workshop at the International Conference on Learning Representations (EmeCom@ICLR22)](https://sites.google.com/view/emecom2022/home). I will lead a discussion group on the topic of the paper at the workshop.

_July 22, 2021:_ My team has won the Safe and Trusted AI Hackathon! We analysed stop-and-search data from the London metropolitan police in terms of disproportionality of stops for minority groups.
