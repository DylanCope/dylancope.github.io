Quotes from students:

> Dylan has been absolutely fantastic, he is always well prepared and goes above and beyond the course material to explain the current state of the art. I've thoroughly enjoyed the tutorial sessions and always felt well informed after them. Thank you so much Dylan!

> I appreciate that you tried to give us an intuitive explanation of the concepts. There is a lot more value in understanding what's going on than just doing the maths. When it comes to complicated formulas I often thought you gave a better explanation than the one in the lectures. Please teach some level 7 AI module next year, need more good TAs :))

> Great

> Good

> I appreciate the small group sessions a lot. They provide good intuitions to the subjects, which I think is important but often neglected, especially for technical topics. They help stimulate our thinking that really helps understanding the concepts and thus invoke my interests in them. They give us space to asks our questions. I think the sessions are overall very well organised and prepared and turn our to be very beneficial. Many thanks.
